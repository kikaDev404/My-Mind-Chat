# My-Mind-Chat

This project is designed to let others "chat with your mind" through an LLM. You can adapt it for different purposes.

For example:

Invite your audience to use the tool to directly converse with your mind.

Instead of sending a traditional resume, configure your mind and share this tool with recruiters so they can interact with it and learn about you.

Build a customer support agent that reflects your knowledge, style, and personality.

Preserve a knowledge archive of your thoughts for friends, family, or future generations.

The possibilities are endless. You can tune your mind for any purpose by editing the my_emotion.txt file.

# Tools
